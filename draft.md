# Prisma

Prisma makes developers productive

Thinking in objects instead of mapping relational data
Queries not classes to avoid complex model objects
Single source of truth for database and application models
Healthy constraints that prevent common pitfalls and antipatterns
An abstraction that make the right thing easy ("pit of success")
Type-safe database queries that can be validated at compile time
Less boilerplate so developers can focus on the important parts of their app
Auto-completion in code editors instead of needing to look up documentation
