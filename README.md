## FAQ

#### What about dynamic provider?

Currently, when generating a Prisma Client, it is specific to a provider (sqlite, postgres or mysql). You cannot reuse the same client and specify a provider which it wasn't generated for. But there is a feature request to do that.
https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/1487#issuecomment-633566370

#### MongoDB support for Prisma 2?

In progress
https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/1277

#### Performance

Not a goal for the beta, optimization will be later
https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+performance

#### Transactions

https://github.com/prisma/prisma-client-js/issues/667
https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/1844
Use write operations with `connect`  
Since 2.1.0 available as experimrntal feature (explicit transactions)

#### Multiple schema files

https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/2377

#### Atomic operations

https://github.com/prisma/prisma-client-js/issues/655

#### ORM can resolve n + 1 problem too

https://mikro-orm.io/docs/nested-populate
Yes, but no type safety in this example.

https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/master/docs/eager-and-lazy-relations.md
In this example I must define it as column definition, what if need both lazy and eager...

#### Why ORM is Partial Typesafety

https://sequelize.org/master/manual/typescript.html#usage (bottom)

#### Why middleware as query engine is needed

Possible, to make prisma framework language indepedent, having such query engine allow to create
prisma cient for another language.
